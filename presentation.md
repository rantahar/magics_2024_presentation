# Data and software services - case thermal camera analysis



## Face temperature measurements from crowd thermal camera image

- Shared experience in the audience
- Temperature measurement using thermal camera footage
- Extracting temperature measurements.
  - Converting the data files to temperatures
  - Can we track individual faces in the video?

## Data and computing is everywhere

![Examples of data and RSE projects. Data collection platform for smart devices - SCI. Make code easily installable - ELEC. Interactive website visualizing force fields - CHEM. Data processing, spreadsheets to code Publishing microscope control data- SCI. DigiTraffic API scraper - BIZ.](projects.png)

## Research Software Engineers

![Researcher - RSE - Software Developer. A researcher is focused on research and may not have software developments skills. A professional software developer is too formal for the chaos of a research project. A research software engineer sits in between, trained in research and software development.](RSE.png)

## Reading the file
- Extracting a grid of temperature values from the seq file data.
- https://github.com/rantahar/seq_file

![Example thermal camera image of 5 people sitting facing the same direction](thermal_example.png)


***


## Face tracking

- Simple face location algorithms:
  - Fitting an oval
  - watershead
- Using a mean temperature image as a guide
- Manual labeling and training a machine learning algorithm
- https://github.com/rantahar/thermal_faces

![Curves displaying multiple individual temperatures around 35C.](temp_data_original.png)

***



## Individual temperatures

- Noice, outliers and spurious correlations
  - Inconsistent face detection
  - Moving subjects
  - Room and camera temperature changes
- Control signal from an empty seat
